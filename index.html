      <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          <h3>Bio</h3>
          A driven and critically minded Software Engineer, having previously studied for a BEng in Software Engineering 
          at The University of Sheffield. I am a collaborative team player, enjoy communicating and have the confidence 
          to speak with others at all levels. I am currently working on my frontend development skills while 
          continuing to grow my portfolio.
          <h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
          I'm currently 3 weeks into an intensive 16 week course covering all of the necessary skills required
          to work as a successful frontend developer.
          <br>
          So far I've learnt how to use HTML to structure a page, and also how to add CSS for styles,
          as well as some basic JavaScript. The most challenging parts of the CSS so far have definitely
          been using either Flexboxes or CSS grids, both took some time to wrap my head around. I also
          found media queries very interesting.
          <h3>What's next?</h3>
          I'm most looking forward to using APIs and also learning about the react framework, while both of 
          these do seem very challenging, they also seem to open up the possibilities for what I can achieve
          as a frontend developer.
